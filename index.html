                    Working on creative projects is an exciting and rewarding process to me. There‚Äôs something magical that happens when a team of creatives collaborate with the shared goal of crafting an unforgettable experience. I feel like the creative and multidisciplinary nature of game development is all about that.

                    I have completed an education in Game Design and Project Management at Uppsala University, Campus Gotland and hold a Masters degree in Entrepreneurship and Business Design from Chalmers University of Technology. Currently, I am working as a Level Designer at River End Games.

                    In my free time, I love climbing, DJ-ing, and board game nights with friends. I love spending time in nature and exploring different cultures around the world!

                                ReLeap is a single player, 2D side scroller runner. A five minute experience where you jump between rooftops, dodge obstacles, and angle your charge jumps to make the perfect landings.

                                The game is played on a custom-built arcade-like controller which consists of a handlebar that you can push and pull to jump and charge your jumps as well as a foot slider to slide beneath obstacles.
